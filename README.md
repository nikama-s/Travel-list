**Travel List** is a simple React-based web application designed to help users create and manage a packing list for their trips, which I developed while studying React. It allows users to add, check off, and remove items from their travel packing list, giving an easy overview of the packing progress. Currently, it has no backend counterpart, but I plan to work on that in the future.

## Features

- **Dynamic List Management**: Easily add, remove, and mark items as packed for any trip.
  
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep an eye on your packing progress with a total item count and the percentage of items packed.

- **Sorting Functionality**: Organize your list by sorting items based on their packed status, making it easier to see whatâ€™s left to pack.

- **Clearing the list**: You can easily clear the entire list anytime, just by pressing the button and confirming your intentions.
